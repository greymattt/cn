# algorithm
## ping server
Step1: Start the program.  
Step2: Import necessary packages.  
Step3: Initialize the ping server with both sockets as null   value.  
Step4: Start the server socket.   
Step5: At the client give the IP address of the server(by   using ifconfig command in command prompt).  
Step6: The client program is then started by starting   socket.  
Step7: At the receiver end, the client is pinged and traced.  
Step8: Stop the program.  
## ping client
Step1: Start the program.  
Step2: Import necessary packages.  
Step3: Initialize the ping client with both sockets as null   value.  
Step4: Start the socket.  
Step5: Get the IP address of the server.  
Step6: Ping the server.  
Step7: At the receiver end, the server is pinged and traced.  
Step8: Stop the program.  

## trace route
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Import necessary packages.
Step 3: Begin main function.
Step 4: execute tracerout command using Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command).
Step 5: Display the output produced by the traceroute command.
STep 6: End program
