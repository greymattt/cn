# Algorithm
## subnet mask and network id
Step1: Get the input from the user by using scanner method.
Step 2: Read the input by using nextLine() and store it.
Step 3: Split the string based on string by using split(“\\”)
Step4 : Convert it into binary.
Step 5: calculating the network mask by using math and logarithmic 
Step 6: get the first address by ANDding the last n bits with 0.
Step7 : get the last address by ANDding the last n bits with
