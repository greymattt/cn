## server
Step1: Start the program and create server and client sockets.  
Step2: Use input streams to get the message from user.   
Step3: Use output streams to send message to the client.  
Step4: Wait for client to display this message and write a new one to be displayed by the server.  
Step5: Display message given at client using input streams read from socket.  
Step6: Stop the program.  

## client
Step1: Start the program and create a client socket that connects to the required host and port.  
Step2: Use input streams read message given by server and print it.  
Step3: Use input streams; get the message from user to be given to the server.  
Step4: Use output streams to write message to the server.  
Step5: Stop the program.
