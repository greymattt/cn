Step5:  Create a new object class file and realine.  
Step6:  If file is exists then FileReader read the content until EOF is reached.  
Step7:  Stop the program.

The requested file from user: filename.txt  
FIle transfered  


## client
Step1:  Import java packages and create class file server.  
Step2:  Create a new server socket and bind it to the port.  
Step3:  Now connection is established.  
Step4:  The object of a BufferReader class is used for storing data content which has been retrieved   from socket object.  
Step5:  The content of file is displayed in the client window and the connection is closed.  
Step6:  Stop the program.
