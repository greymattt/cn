# algorithm
## server
Step 1: Start the program  
Step 2: Import required classes such as BufferReader, InputStreamReader.  
Step 3: Begin main function  
Step 4: Read frame size from user  
STep 5: initial server socket to local host and port  
Step 6: Read the frames from user and transmit frames one by one using for loop  
Step 7: Get the missing frame form client and resend the missing frame  
Step 8: End main function   
Step 9: Stop program   
## client 

Step 1: Start the program    
Step 2: Import required classes such as BufferReader, InputStreamReader.   
Step 3: Begin main function   
Step 5: Connect to server using address and port  
Step 5: Receive frame size from server and receive frames one by one using for loop  
Step 6: Send request to server to resend the missing frame  
Step 7: End main function    
Step 8: Stop program
