# algorithm
## server
Step 1: Start the program  
Step 2: Import required classes such as BufferReader, InputStreamReader.  
Step 3: Begin main function  
Step 4: Initialize server socket to port and accept connections from client  
Step 5: while message is not equal to "exit"  
Step 6: Receive message from client and send acknowledgement to client  
Step 7: End loop   
Step 8: End main function    
Step 9: Stop program    
## client 

Step 1: Start the program   
Step 2: Import required classes such as BufferReader, InputStreamReader.  
Step 3: Begin main function    
Step 4: Connect to server using address and port  
Step 5: Read the number of frames to be sent from user  
Step 6: Send each frame to server and receive  acknowledgement from server  
Step 7: End main function   
Step 8: Stop program
